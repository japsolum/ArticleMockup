You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

  *I can't honestly say I've learned a ton yet. I was pretty familiar with HTML
   before and have also taken the Intro to Programming nanodegree, so most of this
   was already covered except the strike, hr, and sup tags.

  *Most of it was easy so far, didn't have much difficulty with much of the coding.

  *The only two things I can say I had issues with was the feedback extension because
   the first time I tried to use it, it wasn't working properly. And second, still
   learning github so I had to remember how to create and clone to repo.

  *Haven't had to use much of my problem solving skills so far except to go off on
   my own to learn those couple tags I hadn't seen yet.
